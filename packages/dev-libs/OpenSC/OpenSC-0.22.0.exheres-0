SUMMARY="Open source smart card tools and middleware."
DESCRIPTION="
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its main focus is on
cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate their use in security applications
such as authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API
so applications supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it.
On the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with every
software/card that does so, too.
